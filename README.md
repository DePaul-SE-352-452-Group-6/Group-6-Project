## Communication Mechanism

## Decision Made
| # | Area  | Decision | Alternative | Rationale
| ----------- | ----------- | --- | --- |--- |
| 1 | IDE | IntelliJ |Visual Code | Everyone is familiar with it already
| 2 | Dependency Management  | Gradle | Maven | Gradle is easier to get running and doesn't require Maven to be installed on the local machine to get running
| 3 | Code  | Lombok | N/A | It is what was covered in class
| 4 | Configuration Management  | Yaml | Properties | It is what was covered in class and we are new to using it so it will be good to learn it for the future
